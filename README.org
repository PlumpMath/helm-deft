* helm-deft
This is still very much experimental, even though I have been using it
daily for more than a year.

Helm-deft is designed to find matching files in a defined list of directories
*helm-deft-dir-list* and all sharing a common extension *helm-deft-extension*.
Both these variables can be customized.

helm-deft is composed of three helm search sources
- file names: simple match of pattern vs. file name
- file match: shows file names of files where all of the individual patterns
  match anywhere in the file
- file contents: show the lines where the last word in the search patterns
  matches

Additionally, it offers a number of key commands
- =C-r=: Allows to "rotate" the words in the helm search string, e.g.
  =pat1 pat2 pat3= becomes =pat2 pat3 pat1=. Useful, since the grep
  results in the /file contents/ source are only shown based on the
  last word.
- The following commands allow to narrow down the candidates list that
  is used for the grep.
  - =C-d=: Delete file under point from the candidates list (also works
    on multiple mark selection).
  - =C-e=: Allows to set the candidates list to the list of marked files.
